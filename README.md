[![Python packaging](https://github.com/hasnainroopawalla/ShowML/actions/workflows/python_packaging.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/hasnainroopawalla/ShowML/actions/workflows/python_packaging.yml)

**Show** the **ML** Code!

A Python package of Machine Learning Algorithms implemented from scratch.

The aim of this package is to present the working behind fundamental Machine Learning algorithms in a transparent and modular way.

> **_NOTE:_**  The implementations of these algorithms are not thoroughly optimized for high computational efficiency
