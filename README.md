A Python package of Machine Learning Algorithms implemented from scratch.

The aim of this package is to present the working behind fundamental Machine Learning algorithms in a transparent and modular way.

> **_NOTE:_**  The implementations of these algorithms are not thoroughly optimized for high computational efficiency.
